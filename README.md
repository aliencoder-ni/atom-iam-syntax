### Development Notes

**Generating Grammars**

Because AWS Services and available actions change often, so too must our grammar.  We autogenerate the grammar with the provided script

```bash
cd ./lib
bundle install
bundle exec generate-grammars.rb
```

**Extracting The Service map**
* The service map is extracted from the [AWS Policy Generator](https://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html) which stores a javascript object of all service information in the [policies.js file](https://awsiamconsole.s3.amazonaws.com/iam/assets/js/bundles/policies.js).
* This object can also be accessed from within the developer console of the policy generated via: `app.PolicyEditorConfig.serviceMap`

**Atom Grammar Development**
* ⌘+⌥+p -- show current scope
* ⌘+⇧+p -> Window: Reload -- needed to reprocess your changes
* `apm link $SYNTAX_FOLDER` -- install a syntax repo into atom
